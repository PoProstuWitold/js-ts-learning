## About JavaScript and TypeScript

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

#### Characteristics of JavaScript
- Scripting Language. JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language made for client-side execution on the browser
- Interpreter Based
- Event Handling
- Light Weight
- Case Sensitive
- Control Statements
- Objects as first-class citizens
- Functions as First-class citizens(supports functional programming)

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft. TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.

#### Characteristics of TypeScript
- TypeScript is just JavaScript
- JavaScript is TypeScript
- Supports other JS libraries
- Portable
- Compilation
- Strong Static Typing
- Supports type definitions
- Object Oriented Programming
